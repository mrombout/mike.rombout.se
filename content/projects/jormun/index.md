_[The Legend of Jormun](https://mrombout.itch.io/jormun)_ is a mash-up of two common classics. Explore the world and collect as many apples and treasure as you can. But look before you leap, as you collect more apples, you will grow and navigating the world becomes treacherous!

* Explore a large open world!
* Turn-based gameplay!
* Grow up to 460 meters long!
* But one mistake, and you're out (permadeath)!
