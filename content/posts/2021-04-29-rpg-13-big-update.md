After a long hiatus on blog posts, I did manage to add quite some features, but most of the were simple, boring or already largely solved for me.
Non of them interesting enough to write a blog article about.

Nevertheless, I'm doing so anyway because I think I am now at a stage where I have nailed down the most fundamental features of the game like moving around and loading levels, etc.
So I am now at a stage where I have to implement more detailed and more game specific features such as the combat system, user interfaces, quests, etc.

Rather than a lengthy blog of all the technical details I thought I might as well record a video of all the new features that I've built in the meantime.

{{< youtube id="eag2gYhKMh4" title="Dungeons of Draeywin: The Descendants of the Lost One pre-alpha 0.0.3 demo" >}}

New features on order of appearance:

* Character creation screen
* Basic foraging skill
* Inventory screen
* Weapons are now 2D
* Water shader
* Incredibly basic combat
* Door puzzle using basic scripting engine
* Conversations with NPCs
* Small town with moving watermill
* Interiors
* Shopping
* World travel screen
* World travel events
* Big city with NPCs
* Quest journal
* Spellbook
* Local map
* Wait screen
* Day/Night cycle

That's quite a lengthy list!
I might write a blog post about of a couple of features if I decide to refactor or improve them.
For now the main goal for the next milestone is to implement `MQ120` (the second main quest) that involves world traveling and dungeon crawling!
