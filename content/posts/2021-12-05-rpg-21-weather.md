Just to add a little bit of variety to the game I've added a weather system.
It's really simple, so I'm not even going to explain how I did it in detail.

It's some `Particles` and some changes in the `WorldEnvironment`.

In the future I want to use this system to dynamically change weather and environments based on the players location.
I also want to implement seasons which influences the chance for each weather type.
