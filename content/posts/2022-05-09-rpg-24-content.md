It's been a long time since the last update, but that's mostly because I was very busy working on the game!
Instead of working on the engine, I tried building out the games content a little bit to see if I had enough engine to build a proper game.
It turns out I don't, but more about that later.

For now, I'll just drop these screenshots to show a little bit of what I've been doing.

Obviously, most of the graphics are still using "borrowed" textures.
Most of the work I've been putting in is creating the world geometry, create quests, dungeons and items to form a good base for build the rest of the game upon.

It's it for now, I'm off building some more engine stuff now!
